# Design Document

## Overview

The Vitest test suite will provide comprehensive testing coverage for the Katamari-JS game, leveraging Vitest's modern testing capabilities and seamless Vite integration. The design focuses on creating a maintainable, fast, and reliable testing infrastructure that supports the game's modular architecture while providing excellent developer experience through features like hot module replacement for tests, snapshot testing, and detailed coverage reporting.

The testing architecture will mirror the game's modular structure, with dedicated test suites for core systems (scene, physics, audio), entities (katamari, items, environment), game systems (input, level, UI), and utilities (debug, performance, constants). Mock strategies will isolate units under test while integration tests verify component interactions.

### Vitest Configuration Strategy

The Vitest configuration will extend the existing Vite setup to leverage shared build optimizations while providing test-specific configurations:

- **Environment**: jsdom for DOM testing with custom canvas and WebGL mocking
- **Test Globals**: Enabled for describe/it/expect without imports
- **Coverage**: c8 provider with 80% threshold requirements
- **Mocking**: Automatic mocking for external dependencies with manual overrides
- **Performance**: Parallel test execution with worker threads
- **Reporting**: Multiple reporters (default, json, html) for different use cases

## Components and Interfaces

### Test Configuration Module

**Purpose**: Central configuration for Vitest with environment setup and global test utilities.

**Key Features**:
- Custom test environment extending jsdom
- Global setup and teardown hooks
- Mock configuration for Three.js, Cannon-ES, and Tone.js
- Performance monitoring integration
- Coverage reporting configuration

**Interface**:
```javascript
// vitest.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    globals: true,
    setupFiles: ['./tests/helpers/setup.js'],
    coverage: {
      provider: 'c8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
      thresholds: { lines: 80, functions: 80, branches: 80, statements: 80 }
    },
    mockReset: true,
    restoreMocks: true
  }
});
```

### Mock System Architecture

**Three.js Mocks**: Lightweight mock implementations of Three.js classes focusing on method call verification and state tracking rather than full 3D rendering.

**Cannon-ES Mocks**: Physics simulation mocks that track body creation, collision detection calls, and world stepping without actual physics computation.

**Tone.js Mocks**: Audio system mocks that verify sound synthesis calls and parameter changes without audio output.

**Browser API Mocks**: DOM, Canvas, WebGL, and device orientation mocks for testing browser-dependent functionality.

### Unit Testing Framework

**Core Module Tests**: Each core module (scene, physics, audio) will have comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Initialization and configuration
- Public API method behavior
- Error handling and edge cases
- State management and cleanup

**Entity Tests**: Game entities (Katamari, items, environment) will be tested for:
- Creation and initialization
- Update loop behavior
- Collision and interaction logic
- Memory management and disposal

**System Tests**: Game systems (input, level, UI) will verify:
- Event handling and state changes
- Integration with other systems
- Configuration and settings management
- Performance characteristics

### Integration Testing Framework

**Physics-Rendering Integration**: Tests verifying that physics simulation results correctly update visual representations, including position synchronization and collision visualization.

**Audio-Event Integration**: Tests ensuring audio cues trigger correctly based on game events like collisions, level completion, and user interactions.

**Input-System Integration**: Tests validating that keyboard, touch, and gyroscope inputs correctly affect game state and entity behavior.

**Collection Mechanics Integration**: Tests verifying the complete item collection flow from collision detection through size updates and audio feedback.

### Performance Testing Framework

**Frame Rate Monitoring**: Automated tests that simulate various game scenarios and measure frame rate consistency, detecting performance regressions.

**Memory Usage Tracking**: Tests that monitor memory allocation patterns and detect potential memory leaks during extended gameplay sessions.

**Physics Performance**: Benchmarks for physics simulation performance under different object counts and complexity scenarios.

**Rendering Performance**: Tests measuring draw call efficiency and GPU utilization patterns.
