# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive test suite for the Katamari-JS game using Vitest as the testing framework. The test suite will provide unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing capabilities to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and facilitate confident refactoring. The testing infrastructure will be designed to work with the existing modular architecture while maintaining the project's performance requirements and browser compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive unit testing framework, so that I can verify individual game components work correctly in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL run unit tests for all core game modules (scene, physics, audio)
2. WHEN testing game entities THEN the system SHALL verify Katamari, items, and environment components function correctly
3. WHEN testing game systems THEN the system SHALL validate input, level, and UI system behaviors
4. WHEN testing utility modules THEN the system SHALL check debug, performance, and constants modules
5. IF a unit test fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with stack traces
6. WHEN all unit tests pass THEN the system SHALL report 100% success rate with execution time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for game systems, so that I can ensure different components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL verify physics and rendering integration
2. WHEN testing audio integration THEN the system SHALL validate sound effects trigger correctly with game events
3. WHEN testing input integration THEN the system SHALL verify keyboard, touch, and gyroscope inputs affect game state
4. WHEN testing collection mechanics THEN the system SHALL validate item collection affects katamari size and score
5. WHEN testing level progression THEN the system SHALL verify level generation and win conditions work together
6. IF integration tests detect component interaction failures THEN the system SHALL report specific integration points that failed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mocking capabilities for external dependencies, so that I can test game logic without relying on browser APIs or external libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing Three.js dependent code THEN the system SHALL use mocked Three.js objects
2. WHEN testing Cannon-ES physics THEN the system SHALL mock physics world and body interactions
3. WHEN testing Tone.js audio THEN the system SHALL mock audio synthesis and playback
4. WHEN testing browser APIs THEN the system SHALL mock DOM, canvas, and device orientation events
5. WHEN mocks are used THEN the system SHALL verify correct method calls and parameters
6. IF external dependencies change THEN the system SHALL detect interface mismatches through mock validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance testing capabilities, so that I can ensure the game maintains 60 FPS under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL measure frame rate consistency
2. WHEN testing with large numbers of objects THEN the system SHALL verify performance stays within acceptable limits
3. WHEN testing memory usage THEN the system SHALL detect memory leaks in long-running scenarios
4. WHEN testing physics simulation THEN the system SHALL measure physics step execution time
5. WHEN testing rendering performance THEN the system SHALL measure draw call efficiency
6. IF performance degrades below thresholds THEN the system SHALL report specific performance bottlenecks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test coverage reporting, so that I can identify untested code areas and maintain high code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate code coverage reports
2. WHEN coverage is below 80% THEN the system SHALL highlight uncovered code sections
3. WHEN new code is added THEN the system SHALL require corresponding tests to maintain coverage
4. WHEN viewing coverage reports THEN the system SHALL show line, branch, and function coverage
5. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL export results in multiple formats (HTML, JSON, LCOV)
6. IF critical game logic is uncovered THEN the system SHALL fail the build process

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want continuous integration support, so that tests run automatically on code changes and prevent broken code from being merged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically run the full test suite
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL run tests and report results
3. WHEN tests fail in CI THEN the system SHALL prevent code merging
4. WHEN tests pass in CI THEN the system SHALL allow code integration
5. WHEN CI runs tests THEN the system SHALL cache dependencies for faster execution
6. IF CI environment differs from local THEN the system SHALL detect and report environment-specific issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want snapshot testing for game state, so that I can detect unintended changes in game behavior and rendering output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing game initialization THEN the system SHALL capture and compare initial state snapshots
2. WHEN testing level generation THEN the system SHALL verify consistent world generation patterns
3. WHEN testing UI rendering THEN the system SHALL compare DOM structure snapshots
4. WHEN testing game progression THEN the system SHALL validate state transitions match expected patterns
5. WHEN snapshots change THEN the system SHALL require explicit developer approval
6. IF snapshot tests fail THEN the system SHALL show clear diff visualization of changes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test utilities and helpers, so that I can write tests efficiently and maintain consistency across the test suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL provide helper functions for common game setup
2. WHEN testing async operations THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for handling promises and timers
3. WHEN testing game events THEN the system SHALL provide event simulation helpers
4. WHEN testing physics THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for physics world setup and teardown
5. WHEN testing rendering THEN the system SHALL provide Three.js scene setup helpers
6. IF test utilities are missing functionality THEN the system SHALL allow easy extension of helper functions
