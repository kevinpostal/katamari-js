# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will set up automated deployment of the production build to GitHub Pages. The current setup deploys the entire repository, but we need it to deploy only the optimized production build from the `dist` folder that gets generated by the Vite build process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the production build to be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when code is pushed to main, so that the latest optimized version is always available publicly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL trigger a build and deployment workflow
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL execute `npm run build` to generate the production build
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL deploy only the contents of the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL make the site available at the GitHub Pages URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to manually trigger the deployment workflow, so that I can deploy changes without pushing to main.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the GitHub Actions tab THEN the system SHALL provide a manual workflow dispatch option
2. WHEN I trigger the manual deployment THEN the system SHALL execute the same build and deployment process
3. WHEN manual deployment completes THEN the system SHALL update the GitHub Pages site with the new build

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment to use proper Node.js setup and caching, so that builds are fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use Node.js version 18 or higher
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL cache node_modules for faster subsequent builds
3. WHEN the build process fails THEN the system SHALL not deploy and SHALL report the error clearly
4. WHEN the deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide the deployed URL in the workflow output

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment to have proper permissions and security settings, so that it can deploy to GitHub Pages safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use minimal required permissions for GitHub Pages deployment
2. WHEN concurrent deployments are triggered THEN the system SHALL queue them properly without canceling in-progress deployments
3. WHEN the workflow accesses GitHub Pages THEN the system SHALL use the official GitHub Pages actions for security
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL only expose the built static files, not source code
