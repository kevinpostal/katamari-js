# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update GitHub Actions workflow for production build deployment

  - Replace the current static.yml workflow with a proper build and deploy pipeline
  - Configure Node.js environment with version 18 and npm caching
  - Add build step that runs `npm run build` to generate production assets
  - Configure GitHub Pages deployment to use only the `dist/` folder contents
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Add build validation and error handling

  - Implement build failure detection and proper error reporting
  - Add step to verify dist folder exists and contains expected files
  - Configure workflow to fail gracefully if build process encounters errors
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Configure proper permissions and security settings


  - Set minimal required permissions for GitHub Pages deployment
  - Configure concurrency settings to handle multiple deployment attempts
  - Ensure workflow uses official GitHub Pages actions for security
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Add manual deployment trigger capability






  - Configure workflow_dispatch to allow manual triggering from GitHub Actions tab
  - Ensure manual deployments follow the same build and deploy process
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [-] 5. Test and verify deployment workflow



  - Create test commit to verify workflow triggers on push to main
  - Test manual workflow dispatch functionality
  - Verify deployed site loads correctly with production build assets
  - Confirm GitHub Pages URL is accessible and displays the game
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.3_
