# Performance Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical performance issues in the Katamari game where the ball was moving very slowly, spinning without forward movement, and achieving low FPS. The goal is to optimize the physics system, movement mechanics, and rendering performance to match the responsiveness of the working backup implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Katamari Movement Performance

**User Story:** As a player, I want the katamari to move smoothly and responsively when I press movement keys, so that the game feels fluid and enjoyable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses WASD or arrow keys THEN the katamari SHALL move forward immediately without delay
2. WHEN the katamari moves THEN it SHALL roll naturally using physics-based rotation rather than sliding
3. WHEN no input is provided THEN the katamari SHALL gradually slow down with appropriate damping
4. WHEN the katamari rotates THEN it SHALL not spin excessively without forward movement
5. IF the katamari collides with items THEN collision detection SHALL work without runtime errors

### Requirement 2: Physics System Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run at 60 FPS consistently, so that gameplay is smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the physics system updates THEN it SHALL use optimized solver iterations (â‰¤10) for better performance
2. WHEN physics bodies are managed THEN unnecessary debugging and logging SHALL be minimized
3. WHEN contact materials are configured THEN they SHALL use simplified properties to reduce computational overhead
4. WHEN physics bodies are activated/deactivated THEN the process SHALL be throttled to prevent performance spikes
5. IF the frame rate drops below 45 FPS THEN the system SHALL prioritize core gameplay over non-essential features

### Requirement 3: Item Generation Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want items to appear around me without causing performance drops, so that exploration remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN items are generated around the katamari THEN the count SHALL be limited to 15 items per generation cycle
2. WHEN the katamari moves THEN new items SHALL only generate every 80 units of travel to reduce frequency
3. WHEN items are cleaned up THEN the cleanup distance SHALL be optimized to 150 units for better memory management
4. WHEN items fade in THEN the duration SHALL be reduced to 500ms for faster visual feedback
5. IF too many items exist THEN older items SHALL be automatically cleaned up to maintain performance

### Requirement 4: Main Loop Performance

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to prioritize essential gameplay elements, so that movement and collision detection remain responsive even during complex operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main game loop runs THEN physics updates and movement SHALL execute every frame
2. WHEN expensive operations are needed THEN they SHALL be throttled to run only 10% of the time
3. WHEN UI and audio updates occur THEN they SHALL be limited to 30% frequency to reduce overhead
4. WHEN performance monitoring runs THEN it SHALL not impact core gameplay performance
5. IF the system detects performance issues THEN non-critical features SHALL be temporarily disabled

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Stability

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to handle errors gracefully without crashing, so that I can continue playing even if minor issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collision detection occurs THEN all item properties SHALL be validated before use
2. WHEN physics bodies are accessed THEN null checks SHALL prevent runtime errors
3. WHEN items are collected THEN the collection process SHALL handle missing or invalid data gracefully
4. WHEN debugging information is logged THEN it SHALL not cause performance degradation
5. IF invalid game states are detected THEN the system SHALL recover automatically without user intervention
